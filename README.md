# RubikCubeSolver
C# library that solves the Rubik's cube with a simple graphical interface to test it.

This project was developed during the high school period with other student who I will add as contributors to the repository.

**Warnings: The library still contains bugs and still can't fix the cube all the time, I'm working on it. I would also like to include the possibility of recreating the situation in a cube from the interface.**
